To-Do

- [ ] Make Issue inside of the same program (Without exit from the program - Bridgex)
- [ ] Make a system to see the future "features" of program...
- [ ] Make a historial of converted files (Inside program)
- [ ] Limit the file size
- [ ] When the file is ok, but not have a content, show again the initial Help (Logo with shortcuts, initial screen)
- [ ] Make a temporal file or inside database, to save the content extracted
  > Notes: This because when language is changed, the UI is reinitialized and the content extracted is deleted (from the square inside program...).
- [ ] Fix program "freeze", when converting, the program is frozen to can convert the file
- [ ] Add a dialog to show the shortcuts available
- [ ] Update the manager and its use inside the program
  > Notes: The database isn't used correctly, bad practices are here
- [ ] Remove focus of links clicked
  > Notes: When links are clicked, these not remove the focus in, because same cause, when link is clicked, and return inside the program, if "enter" is key down, the "link" is actioned again!
- [ ] Save the size when close/exit (when reopen, the size is equal to last size configured)
- [ ] Connect "Shortcut" 'CTRL + S' to save/convert the document.
- [ ] ~If this project is viral in future, add the stars count from GitHub~
