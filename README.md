**Bridge** is a 'Visual _Bridge_' between the [`general-users 🙆🏻‍♂️🙆🏻‍♀️`, `devs 👩🏻‍💻`] and the [**Markitdown**](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) library that allows convert a great variety of files to markdown format, which is very used around world, is so easy understand it and is very easy to write it!

```shell
pip install bridge
```

## Why Bridge

Because is easy to use, is a Python GUI (Thanks to [Pyside6(Qt For Python)](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython-6/))

## Why this name (Bridge)?

Because is easy to remember, easy to pronounce and because the program idea is based in a "Bridge" between the users and the [**Markitdown**](https://github.com/microsoft/markitdown) library for python, easy to use, with graphic interface, just that 😁.

## What's Bridge?

**Bridge** is a **File Converter**, allow a great variety of files such as Power Point (**.pptx**), Word (**.docx**), PDF, Electronics Publications (**.epub**), Compressed files (**.zip**) and other files are allowed to convert.

## What isn't Bridge?

**Bridge** isn't a _IDE_, text editor, _markdown editor_, document viewer. The interface provided is just a **Lite Preview** where you can **edit** the incorrect formats before save the **Markdown File**.
